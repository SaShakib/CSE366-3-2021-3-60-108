#Assignment: Robot Task Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm
Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to develop and implement a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the
assignment of multiple robots to a set of tasks in a dynamic production environment. Your primary
objectives are to minimize the total production time, ensure a balanced workload across robots, and
prioritize critical tasks effectively. Additionally, you will create a detailed visualization to illustrate the final task assignments, robot efficiencies, and task priorities.

Assignment Details
--. Background:
• You have a set of tasks, each with a specified duration and priority.
• A pool of robots is available, each with a unique efficiency factor.
• The production environment is dynamic, with tasks and priorities potentially changing
over time.

some methods in this project: 
def generate_mock_data(num_tasks=10, num_robots=5): -- generate the background environment
def fitness_function(population, task_durations, task_priorities, robot_efficiencies): -- fitness function to select parent
def select_parents(population, fitness): -- how mating pool is created
def crossover(parents, num_offspring): -- how new generation is developed 
def mutation(offspring, mutation_rate, robot_efficiencies): -- how each selected population is mutated 
def run_genetic_algorithm(task_durations, task_priorities, robot_efficiencies):  -- run from main function and contains all the calls for selection, mutation and crossover
def visualize_assignments_improved(solution, task_durations, task_priorities, robot_efficiencies): -- visualize the grid 

run the main function and change some parameter to see different type of result.
