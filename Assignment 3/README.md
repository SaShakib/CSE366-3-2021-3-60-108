Assignment 3 - Coffee leaf disease detection using Mobilenetv2 and DenseNet21 


Discussion: 
I have used multiple cnn architecture: 
but some of them gives overfitting model first, then applying some changes and applying the regularization and cross fold I have fixed the overfitting problem. 
then the problem was the validation accuracy was not increasing due to lack of enough data. 
I resolved this problem using the augmentation of the data. 
each folder has 700 images
